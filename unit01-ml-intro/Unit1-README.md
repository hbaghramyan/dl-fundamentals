# Deep Learning Fundamentals Unit 1

## Welcome to Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This Studio provides a reproducible environment with the supplementary code for Unit 1 of the [**Deep Learning Fundamentals**](https://lightning.ai/pages/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/) class by Sebastian Raschka, which is freely available at Lightning AI.

In this Studio, you will learn how to code a simple perceptron algorithm in Python, a linear classifier that can be used to separate data belong to two different classes.

## About Unit 1: Welcome to Machine Learning and Deep Learning



Welcome to this exciting journey into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this first unit, you will learn about the big picture behind machine learning and how it’s related to deep learning and artificial intelligence.

Moreover, we will introduce the concepts of a typical machine learning workflow and implement a classifier in Python. 

Specifically, via the videos and code examples in Unit 1.6 included in the Studio, we implement one of the first machine learning algorithms — a perceptron classifier — in Python. This perceptron algorithm is a linear classifier, which can be trained to separate two different classes via a linear decision boundary, as shown below:

As shown above, a perceptron classifier is a type of linear binary classifier that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The algorithm allows for the classification of inputs into two distinct classes, making it an important building block for understanding machine learning. 

The perceptron, beyond its historical significance as one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of neural networks, is known for its simplicity and efficiency in teaching the basic principles of machine learning, such as the concept of weight adjustment based on errors, which is a precursor to more complex algorithms covered in later Units. 

In short, the perceptron is particularly useful for problems that are linearly separable, and its study provides a solid groundwork for understanding more advanced neural network architectures.
