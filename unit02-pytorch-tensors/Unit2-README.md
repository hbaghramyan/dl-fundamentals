# Deep Learning Fundamentals Unit 2

## Introduction to Working with Tensors in PyTorch

What are tensors? We’re glad you asked. In Unit 2, you will learn more about tensors and familiarize ourselves with PyTorch, the most widely used deep learning library.

This Studio provides a reproducible environment with the supplementary code for Unit 2 of the [**Deep Learning Fundamentals**](https://lightning.ai/pages/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/) class by Sebastian Raschka, which is freely available at Lightning AI.

## About Unit 2: Introduction to Working with Tensors in PyTorch

In Unit 2, we introduce PyTorch. PyTorch is an open-source library for deep learning library that is widely used in both academia and industry. PyTorch originated from the original Torch project, a deep learning framework based on the programming language Lua. In the upcoming videos, we will dive deeper into PyTorch’s tensor data structure before implementing and training deep neural networks.

Then, we'll introduce tensors as a mathematical concept: a generalization of vectors, matrices etc. However, in a computational context, we usually think of tensors as data containers. If you are familiar with NumPy arrays, PyTorch tensors are essentially a similar concept.

In short, we can think PyTorch tensors as fancy NumPy arrays that support additional functionality, such as automatic differentation and computations on a GPU.
